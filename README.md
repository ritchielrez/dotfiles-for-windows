## What is dotfiles?

Dotfiles are the customization files that are used to personalize your Linux or other Unix-based system.  You can tell that a file is a dotfile because the name of the file will begin with a periodâ€“a dot!  The period at the beginning of a filename or directory name indicates that it is a hidden file or directory.  This repository contains my personal dotfiles.  They are stored here for convenience so that I may quickly access them on new machines or new installs.  Also, others may find some of my configurations helpful in customizing their own dotfiles.



## Configs of mine: 

1. Powershell ( *my current Windows shell* )
2. Clangd ( *my C++ lsp client, that I use for C++ coding* )
3. Oh-my-posh ( *my prompt* )


## What to do with dotfiles?

There are a hundred ways to manage your dotfiles. Personally, I use the **Git and Github** for managing my dotfiles.
